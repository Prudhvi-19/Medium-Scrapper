INSERT INTO `Article` VALUES (1,'How a Business Leader Can Think Like a Futurist','Advice from futurism consultants on how businesses can brace for the future',_binary 'This is the time of year when we’re primed to look ahead. In recent weeks, you’ve probably laid out personal and professional goals, plans, and road maps for the next 12 months. And if you’re doing it on behalf of an entire company, you’re thinking even further into the future. Or at least you should be.Even a year can feel like a lifetime away, especially when it’s hard to predict what will happen in the next quarter. But futurists, people who think and write about what’s to come, advise that CEOs need to be thinking years or even decades down the road.Remember that the future doesn’t just happen — we shape it every day.I interviewed three prominent futurists — Alexandra Levit, a partner at the consulting firm PeopleResults and author of Humanity Works: Merging Technologies and People for the Workforce of the Future; Mahrinah von Schlegel, executive director of the technology-focused nonprofit Embassy2.0; and writer Richard Watson, a lecturer at Imperial College London and author of the What’s Next report — about how business leaders can get themselves into a more future-oriented mindset.Below, they explain how companies and the people running them can learn to predict the major shifts that could affect their operations — in technology, workforce, social trends — and how to adapt accordingly. Responses have been lightly edited for length and clarity.MEDIUM: Let’s start with the basics. What does it mean to be a futurist?Alexandra Levit: I’m not sure there’s an official consensus on the definition, but to me, being a futurist means paying attention to new patterns and trends that are slowly percolating up through the market or society that have the potential to catch on in a major way. It’s about coming up with possible scenarios for the future given these developments.Mahrinah von Schlegel: A futurist is someone who aggressively predicts future trends, modes of operation, and ways of being, as opposed to people who are more focused on understanding present conditions or past histories and lessons. While I believe people can learn to think in a more futurist fashion, I also feel that everyone is naturally inclined to their own temporal focus — past, present, future — and we can all learn from one another in this regard.Richard Watson: The dirty little secret here is that, most of the time, I’m not thinking or writing about the future at all. I’m using “the future” as an excuse to think deeply about what people are doing right now and to get others to question what they are doing and where they are going.What is the right time frame for futurist thinking? How much energy should go into considering scenarios for the next month, year, decade, century?Alexandra Levit: For me, the ideal time frame is five to 10 years, because although no one can successfully predict the future, in this window you’re more likely to be able to clearly see where things are going according to current operating models. Now, in 2019, I think anything beyond 10 to 15 years is reasonably futile, because we bump up against the technological singularity — the time when machine intelligence becomes so sophisticated that it causes currently unfathomable changes to human existence.Mahrinah von Schlegel: The right time for futurist thinking is yesterday. One needs to constantly be planning for the future and adjusting for updated hypotheses. Futurism fails when we hold on too strongly to specific potentials that are proven nonviable or when a better potential is possible.Richard Watson: Anything more than the next quarter is great, and more than 12 months is fantastic. However, I like five to 15 years for most things. But to really test people’s thinking, 15 to 20 years is about right in my view. You need to get far out to escape the gravitational pull of the present.What are some specific tools leaders can use to imagine and prepare for the future?Alexandra Levit: Read a ton, and consult experts in your field about what they’re seeing. Futurists use tools that systematize these recommendations, including scenario planning, environmental scanning, Delphi surveying, and individual software programs like Fibres, Futures Platform, and Athena.Scenario planning is developing a group of potential realities about what might happen in the future of business, and your organization specifically. It takes into account uncertainties as well as major disruptions that are likely to affect your business, a discussion of the implications for each potential reality, and how strategy should be appropriately adjusted if certain realities come to fruition.Environmental scanning provides a holistic view of the world that involves extensive research and reporting on global, societal, economic, and demographic trends that are likely to impact your business. It drills down further to your industry and your competitors and how the world in which your business operates is likely to shift over the next several years. Many environmental scans also incorporate a review of your organization’s opportunities and challenges in the years to come given the larger factors you’ve uncovered.The Delphi surveying method relies on expert opinion to devise a group of potential future scenarios. After identifying a panel of experts in your industry, you go through at least two rounds of inquiry. In the first, you ask your panel to list developments that will most greatly impact your business in the near future. Based on the ideas that come in, you might develop a survey to gain consensus about these on a larger scale, or you might go back to the panel to get some synthesis of opinions. The goal is to leverage a structured group to converge on the most likely scenario.Mahrinah von Schlegel: Global news from a variety of trusted sources and data inputs are critical for quantitative predictions. What also becomes very important is understanding intersectional industry potentials. For example, what is the potential for A.I. and telemedicine to revolutionize the health of wider distributed populations?Richard Watson: First, just stop and think once in a while. Switch off those blinking devices and go for a walk or look out a window. Reclaim weekends and holidays as distraction-free thinking zones.Beyond this, trend watching is generally a worthwhile defensive play. And practice scenario thinking as a way of challenging “inevitable” futures. One of the biggest traps when thinking about the future is not separating what’s probable — conventional wisdom, in many instances — from what’s possible.I developed a tool called the three Ps—for past, present, and probable futures—with Alex Ayad at Imperial College London to address this. Start with some broad categories that impact you. Then consider the present drivers or megatrends. Space is limited if you are mapping on a simple sheet of paper, so you cannot waffle or have a huge list that’s all-encompassing. Next, probable: We use 50 percent chance or greater, usually 10, 15, or 20 years into the future. You can agree on this with the group or seek external expert guidance. Lastly, possible: What’s hugely impactful, highly improbable, but not actually impossible?For CEOs, a big question in the coming years will be shifts in corporate structures and financial markets. How do you see those shifting, and what will be the drivers of that change?Alexandra Levit: Generally speaking, corporate structures will become flatter and more specialized, with fewer full-time employees and a network of virtual and contract workers who move in and out of the organization fluidly (including boomers who work fewer hours but still contribute, unlike prior generations that were forced to fully retire at a certain age). The widespread use of flextime and remote work means that your success and productivity in a job will be judged by your results, not where or when you accomplished them.Mahrinah von Schlegel: As we move to a predicted 40 to 45 percent freelancer economy in 2025, top-down structural hierarchies no longer make sense. New and distributed ownership structures must emerge to accommodate. This is driven by continued wealth redistribution and a need to grow middle-class stability, which current structures no longer service, as well as the growing need for highly skilled technical labor in the workforce above traditional four-year degrees.Richard Watson: In very general terms, we will see a shift away from the pyramidal structures of yesteryear toward more fluid, open networks. For example, why do we insist on people going to the same building, with the same people, every day to go to work? If you are fundamentally paying people to think, why does it matter so much when and where this happens?With regard to financial markets, I’d like to think there will be less emphasis on short-term financial results, but I think the only way that will happen is if the whole thing comes crashing down again. Also, broader definitions of “profit” and much wider definitions of “costs” — to society at large, future generations, the environment, etc. I think we might see a slight shift toward smaller firms, employee-owned firms, and, I’d like to hope, ethics and integrity becoming more important than short-term profit.As it becomes increasingly challenging for employees to make a living in a typical 40-hour workweek, how do you see the relationship between the employer and employee evolving in response?Alexandra Levit: In a general sense, employers will probably not “take care” of people the way they do today. Most employees will work in a contract capacity, meaning they have to continually sell themselves and their value to organizations. One area of specialty won’t last very long, and individuals will be responsible for continuously reskilling and upskilling to ensure they’re providing what the market needs. At the same time, demographic shifts mean that employers may not have the local talent they require and will have to become more flexible about building virtual teams so they can employ the best people for the job.Mahrinah von Schlegel: Employers no longer need to maintain standing offices and can significantly reduce overhead costs through outsourcing work. This allows for extreme skill-set specialization and the rise of specialized agencies and competition for talent among them.Richard Watson: There’s a shift toward working on multiple projects and working for multiple employers — free agent, part-time working from anywhere. However, while this might appeal for a while, and to younger people, I think this creates uncertainty and anxiety, and we might see a shift back toward more stable and permanent employment. For one thing, how do you create a corporate culture if nobody stays for very long and half the people are never in the office? Work is fundamentally social, and I think physical presence really matters. As to where the power sits, people talk about power shifting to the employee, but I don’t see that except in exceptional circumstances where an employee has a skill that’s very valuable.If you had one piece of advice for a CEO looking to get into the futurist mindset, what would it be?Alexandra Levit: Be proactive. Instead of insisting on a laser focus on your immediate business priorities tomorrow, keep your head up, your eyes open, and your mind curious. Take responsibility for identifying disruptions in your industry and training your workforce to cope with them. Remember that the future doesn’t just happen — we shape it every day.Mahrinah von Schlegel: If the understanding of future shifts and market potential aren’t your natural way of thinking, find futurists you like and respect and follow their social media accounts, set Google alerts, and follow their work.Richard Watson: Very simple. Think further ahead! And one more: CEOs should always ask themselves what assumptions they are making, especially the ones they don’t know about.',_binary ' https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/fit/c/120/120/1*bSqzYWi1U_yrN9uJ-RWJ5A.jpeg https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/fit/c/160/160/1*bSqzYWi1U_yrN9uJ-RWJ5A.jpeg https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/fit/c/300/300/1*bSqzYWi1U_yrN9uJ-RWJ5A.jpeg','494 claps','Carine Carmy',_binary 'Go-to-market expert, strategist & writer | Formerly at Amino, Shapeways, Monitor Group & all over | Writing about tech, art, design, health, & daily absurdities','Jan 15','8 min read'),(2,'Why Is It So Hard to Make a Computer Talk Like a Human?','The next generation of computerized voices has to be human enough to connect with but not so human that we feel we’re being lied to. That’s no small feat.',_binary 'When our machines first began speaking to us, it was in the simple language of children. Some of those voices were even designed for kids — my Speak & Spell was a box with a handle and a tiny green screen that tested my skills in a grating tone, but I still heard that voice sometimes in my dreams. Teddy Ruxpin’s words played from cassette tapes popped into his back, but his mouth moved at just the right cadence, which made him feel almost alive. At least to a kid.For adults, however, the clunky computerized voices of the 1980s, ’90s, and early aughts were far from real. When the train’s voice announced that the next stop was Port Chester using two words instead of “porchester” — we knew: That was a machine. It could not know that we New Yorkers pronounced this place as one word, not two. It was simple: A voice that sounded human was a person; a voice that sounded like a machine was a machine.This was fine when all we needed were announcements that were basic, short phrases. But if there is a fire on the train, we all instinctively want to hear a human voice guiding us — and not just because it would calm our nerves. It’s because, as studies have shown, mechanized voices are very difficult for us to comprehend for anything longer than a short sentence. We’ve evolved to read nonverbal voice cues while we listen to our fellow humans, and we get distracted when they’re missing — that distraction is what makes computerized voices tough to follow.If were are going to replace assistants (or ourselves) with Google Assistant, or if we want a real conversation with the Alexa of the future, it has to converse like a human — responding to verbal cues and following the rhythm, music, and often freewheeling flow of human conversation. To be truly useful to us, in other words, we need computers to sound human. And that’s extremely difficult.What stands in the way? Prosody. That’s the intonation, tone, stress, and rhythm that give our voices their unique stamp. It’s not the words we say—it’s how we say them. “The secret to the human voice is the melodies,” says Emma Rodero, a professor in the Department of Communication at Pompeu Fabra University in Barcelona. Rodero has researched nonhuman voices extensively and says that outside the actual words we use, there’s so much going on that it’s tough to teach a computer all of it.What we hear now are manipulated human voices, chosen for us by the people who create them; a voice-only Frankenstein.“Intonation is a combination of four qualities: tone (the most important), speech rate, intensity, and loudness. I can do multiple combinations of those when I talk. Siri can’t,” Rodero says, who says she has worked with voice engineers and provided them with a list of intonations connected to emotions, including joy, sadness, and everything in between. But there’s the inherent limitation of being a machine — they can spit out only what we put in—and each of us is unique in myriad ways. “When you are happy, you have a lot of ways to express this happiness in your voice. The problem is that we cannot put that into a computer,” Rodero says. “This is a problem for engineers: Algorithms are limited, but my voice is not limited.”Tech companies have gotten around some of this by choosing a human voice with lots of personality to input into their A.I. — which then puts them together in new combos to form speech — from the get-go. When it came time to choose the voice for IBM’s Debater (an A.I. designed to debate humans), the company held an audition and chose 20 voice actors. The winner was picked via a subjective judgment by the IBM team, who asked themselves questions about which debate-style voice they preferred: “Was I moved? Did he or she convince me? Did they have the right amount of persuasion and passion?” says IBM’s Andy Aaron, who worked on Project Debater.That was just the start of creating the Debater voice: “We collected something like 150,000 words [from our voice actor], which amounts to 20 hours of speech recorded,” says Ron Hooray, also with IBM’s Project Debater. “A team of labelers had to spend a lot of time to annotate it according to word emphasis and then run a lot of analysis. Then we divided that into phonemes, and for each one, we have a lot of metadata — whether the pitch is low or high, the duration, etc.—and we had to extract intonations. Then we had to do a lot of manual correction.” They also applied deep learning to get prosody right — or at least close, Hooray says.Amazon is very focused on prosody for Alexa and also spent time looking for the right voice that “has a personality to reflect Alexa’s persona — smart, humble, and helpful,” says Manoj Sindhwani, the director of Alexa Speech at Amazon. But that voice will differ depending on what Amazon calls “locales.” Alexa now speaks in six languages, and its programming reflects 14 localized experiences. “We select a new voice that appeals to our customers in that locale, making sure that the voice reflects the Alexa persona [there], building language understanding, helping her to understand semantics and context that may differ by region, and developing a local ‘personality’ that will surprise and delight customers,” Sindhwani says. The aim is not just one natural-sounding voice, but many, each matching a specific group of people it serves.So what we hear now and in the near future are manipulated human voices, chosen for us by the people who create them: a voice-only Frankenstein, mostly limited to repeating your grocery list.Alexa’s voice is also being programmed to be context aware — it can speak differently depending on the setting. “We have used context to make Alexa’s decision-making smarter… even beyond recognizing and understanding words,” Sindhwani says. This ability to vary speaking style based on context (listen to examples here) matters — how we speak to our fathers, during a presentation, or to our boss varies naturally. A really smart voice should do the same. The Amazon team is getting closer: Alexa can even understand when it’s being whispered to — and will whisper back.As these voices get better, it’s important for the system not to trick you. You want a signal to the listener that it’s a robot.We are still on that edge before fake voices seriously compete with the real. Tech’s vociferous mashup is still relatively easy to pick out as faux. (Here’s a fun way to test your “is it human?” ear.) IBM’s Project Debater — whip-smart as it is in arguing in classic debate style — can only debate. Alexa does its best to respond to general conversation but fails when it’s pushed beyond a certain set of what Amazon calls “skills.” Similarly, Google Assistant responds to “actions.” In either case, it falls on the human to learn how to speak to the machine.Still, for all those complications, experts believe we’re just a few breakthroughs away from computers that can converse with humans. Getting there will solve a host of technological issues but will introduce just as many legal and ethical ones. When Google first demoed its new Duplex technology last year, it was a remarkable moment: The Google Assistant voice was so natural sounding when it called and asked for a salon appointment and made a dinner reservation — two tasks it had been deeply trained to carry out — that the audience delighted… and freaked out. Zeynep Tufekci, a professor at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill who studies tech’s social impacts, called it “deceitful” and “so obviously wrong” on Twitter. She was far from the only one disturbed by the fact that the harried human worker on the other end of the phone seemed to have no idea they were talking to a machine. It’s a breakthrough potentially ripe for abuse.Google said it will be “designing this feature with disclosure built in, and we’ll make sure the system is appropriately identified” — and in its very earliest iteration (calling select restaurants for reservations), it appears to do so. IBM’s Andy Aaron sees this as a positive step. “As these voices get better, it’s important for the system not to trick you,” he says. For all the effort to make a voice that talks like a person, “You want a signal to the listener that it’s a robot.”',_binary ' https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/fit/c/120/120/0*qS6nXmMg0nOPDrNp.png https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/fit/c/160/160/0*qS6nXmMg0nOPDrNp.png https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/fit/c/300/300/0*qS6nXmMg0nOPDrNp.png','582 claps','Starre Julia Vartan',_binary 'AKA The Curious Human.

Described as a generally nice guy, he had attempted to convince her that code camps were “basically the new engineering degree.” He had gone to one himself, and, in the end, the two of them had ended up in the same place. This, understandably, gave her pause; after all, she had attended the University of Waterloo’s computer engineering program, and then the University of Toronto for her master’s in engineering.After some thought, she asked whether the particular code camp he had attended had touched on security, infrastructure, or operating systems; it was a question asked with the intention of understanding his comparison. Flustered, he responded that roles in those areas were so niche that his statement still stood.My friend recognized that her co-worker’s statement had some truth to it. Yes, they had ended up in the same place. What troubled her was that he failed to understand that the breadth of his knowledge was unlikely to take him to the deeply technical reaches of big tech, where he ultimately wanted to end up.He just didn’t know what he didn’t know. And not only that, he believed that my friend, in completing her degrees, was the one who had been conned.Code Camps and the Messaging Around ThemThere is a pattern of rhetoric that multiple colleagues of mine have observed with code camp graduates, and it includes the belief that web and app development are essentially the entirety of the field.Languages and skillsets taught by coding boot camps. All screenshots: Bhavya KashyapIt isn’t surprising. The current narrative is just that; coding is becoming synonymous with web development. This equivalence can be seen on several boot camp sites, and even in highly frequented publications such as the New York Times.The industry is expanding rapidly, but areas like SaaS, devices, security, systems engineering (required for coveted roles building self-driving cars), and even game development are starving for talent. And that is the irony. Conceptually, code camps exist as a way to transition non-tech workers to tech, creating a cheap pipeline of skilled labor. Workers are flocking to these camps, but the output is so skewed toward web development that the industry is left struggling to find tech talent in other areas.One could argue that the self-starters will have already understood there is only so much a 24-week boot camp can teach you; they will have figured out where to go and where their talents lie. But exposure is invaluable, especially when a phenomenon such as this is so widespread. After all, exposure is what fills boot camp seats in the first place.There is value in code camps as they are, and this is not an attack on the concept. They are an accessible means to get into the field — for people who were unable to afford a technical education, for people who realized their calling too late, or even for those who just need to make a little more money. The allure and instant gratification of web and mobile development are understandable, especially with the current demand. There’s little overhead required to download frameworks and text editors, and potentially a ton of reward. And the beauty of these camps is that they can be gateways to other kinds of development, engineering, or even academic computer science.I just don’t know how often those gates are entered.Coding is not equivalent to computer science, which is not equivalent to software/computer engineering, which is not equivalent to STEM.Code. Code, code, code, code, code. Code has now become synonymous with computer science. If you are a CS grad, you have probably noticed this, and you know that this equivalence is a disservice to both disciplines. If you are not in this line of work, you may wonder what the difference is. The nuances lie not just in skill set, but also in focus — though, of course, there is overlap.Coding is tactical. It is the process of solving immediate problems and building something to get it to work. Software engineering expands on this by bringing in strategy and applying engineering concepts and fundamentals to build robust and sustainable solutions. Computer engineering includes some degree of software engineering, but incorporates hardware as well — the materials required to create tablets, phones, and consoles. And finally, there is computer science — in a way, the most philosophical of them all — which includes deep dives into mathematics and why different types of algorithms, data structures, and computational methods work the way that they do.While code camps are the right solution for many people, the skills and modes of thinking taught by formal CS programs are critical to moving tech forward. This is why few camp graduates end up in big tech, despite what they are sold. These abilities are required to provide the public with services like Google Maps or Waze, which use algorithms such as Dijkstra’s, or tools such as MongoDB or the Android SDK, whose customers inevitably include code camp attendees. Yes, many boot camps do touch on algorithms and data structures, but the speed and intensity with which they are covered do not provide the same depth. The concepts are usually taught with the mindset that they are needed to crack interviews, which contextualizes them very differently.The best employers.The demand for computer science professionals has been growing rapidly and shows no signs of ebbing. According to data gathered by Code.org, there are 570,926 open computing jobs available nationwide. However, the number of homegrown CS grads last year was only 49,291.According to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, overall employment in computer and information technology is expected to increase by 13 percent between 2016 and 2026. Even if CS graduation rates were to rise in the same time frame, the absolute numbers would have to increase by a full order of magnitude to catch up. Recent trends suggest that students are enrolling in CS programs in greater numbers, but more needs to be done to close the gap.Thankfully, education on the importance of CS has skyrocketed in the past few years. That is great, but a similar problem arises even here.A quick perusal of major coding initiative websites shows that the terms “computer science” and “STEM” have become conflated. Even computerscience.org appears to confuse the terms. A paragraph titled “Why aren’t more women involved in computer science?” is accompanied by a statement indicating that only 12 percent of engineers are female.12% of what kinds of engineers?To be fair, the engineering statistic is followed with additional data clarifying that women make up 25 percent of “computer science-related professions.” But why confuse things by highlighting data from the broad field of engineering in a discussion specifically about computer science? To people who don’t know any better, the implication is that the terms are interchangeable.Framing CS as the sector most representative of STEM funnels people who want to explore the industry into one narrow field within it. This means other areas of the stack miss out on fresh blood and diversity. You’d be surprised at how creative one can be when it comes to things like low-level API design or systems engineering. Or bus design, which requires electrical engineering. Or flash storage development (e.g., flash drives and phone storage), which requires knowledge of materials science. And let’s not forget areas like chassis/form-factor design, where industrial engineers and designers are needed to create the beautiful and sleek exteriors of Surfaces, Xboxes, and Pixel 3s. These subjects are ignored almost entirely in conversations about tech workers.If young university applicants or even older tech-hopefuls do not understand their possibilities, they will take the path of least resistance.Many professional engineers, including myself, are disconcerted by the highly-focused channeling of workers toward boot camps and CS programs that sway toward higher-level, client-side programming. This trend trains people to focus on areas that benefit only a portion of tech. The industry needs people who possess a deeper understanding of engineering so that the empty positions around us can be filled. If young university applicants or even older tech-hopefuls do not understand their possibilities, they will take the path of least resistance. Ultimately we will lose the attention of future engineering talent, from core software engineering, to civil and mechanical, to web and application development.Selling STEM Dreams to MinoritiesThere is the minority spin to this as well. Code.org, Women Who Code, Girls Who Code, Black Girls Code. These minority-focused organizations, inadvertently or not, propagate the idea that coding is STEM. They are championed for bringing women to science and engineering; this claim only holds because the public perception of these areas has, again, been narrowed down to code.Within that context, many of these initiatives predominantly stick to teaching scripting and functional languages — but with youth in particular, there is immense value in even gently introducing languages like C and C++ so they are seen as less scary. Imposter syndrome is a real factor in dropout rates among minorities pursuing CS degrees; providing them with the tools to tackle these harder languages, which are inevitably included in all CS curricula, can boost their confidence.Interestingly, we go back to code camps, as they are increasingly sold to minorities as a way to bridge the representation gap. Facebook ads constantly push these programs. The programs’ leaders run them with (perhaps genuine) earnestness, but code camps ultimately function only as a Band-Aid. The immediate results of these programs are unclear — not all camps publish hiring rates, and even when they do, critics argue they are misleading.There is an obvious dearth of equivalent camps for skill sets beyond coding, and that is because the companies that need those skill sets don’t fund them.In the spirit of optimism, though, I will assume that placement rates are indeed high. Code camp grads often appear to get jobs at startups or mid-sized companies a few months out of camp. Then, with a few years of experience, some are able to hop over to giants like Google or Amazon.But the bulk of these minority graduates do not end up in leadership positions, especially not at the aforementioned giants. Already fighting against notions of incompetency, the code camp badge often taints their reputation further, sometimes disqualifying them entirely from certain MFAANG interviews. I have personally heard peers aggressively question the credentials of minority candidates with these types of certifications on their resumes. This is, unfortunately, the current state of affairs, so it is clear that minority talent is presently better served by doing formal STEM degrees. Of course, getting them into that funnel is a different story.Techgirlz covers a balanced set of engineering topics that includes both applied and abstract concepts.Introducing minorities to CS is a first step, but again, we need to diversify engineering disciplines. I won’t repeat it in detail, but — yes — we need women, Black, Latinx, and other underrepresented minorities in all areas of the stack, in big companies as well as small ones. Fulfilling these needs is about more than bettering the industry and bringing great products to customers. It’s also a step towards societal and socioeconomic empowerment.What’s Next?I’ve outlined my concerns, but all of them resolve to a blank. Whose job is it to provide education on all the possibilities for roles in tech?There is an obvious dearth of equivalent camps for skill sets beyond coding, and that is because the companies that need those skill sets don’t fund them. While code camps and general CS initiatives are a part of this scenario, they have done a lot of good, and have opened doors for a lot of people. They are not obligated to expand their attendees’ knowledge base to include the areas listed above, though perhaps they should.My conclusion, still, is that messaging is important. As an industry, we cannot continue to skew the conversation so heavily toward web/app development and high-level CS. We should do better so that science, tech, and engineering roles are filled according to their demand. We need new talent to design OS experiences, motherboards, cameras, screens, cases, assembly lines, and servers to push updates. After all, you can’t build an iPhone with Python.',_binary ' https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/fit/c/120/120/1*q_RTn2GC94RvBut_tc7VhA.jpeg https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1200/1*n4yjmHraZgu9OXIQHC1H4w.png https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1200/1*Ng7LhQWvDeO0YV9-65YlHQ.png https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2000/1*4yxfGm5VOenygm2yAes_rQ.png https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2000/1*anT7JbTM5uQuw-BaqZk0Ng.png https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/fit/c/160/160/1*q_RTn2GC94RvBut_tc7VhA.jpeg https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/fit/c/300/300/1*q_RTn2GC94RvBut_tc7VhA.jpeg','14.9K claps','Bhavya Kashyap',_binary 'I work at Amazon.

The product has been shipping, in some form or other, for a few months or even years. I’ve long ago given up any hope of spotting a unicorn here — the life-changing product everyone will be talking about. The big companies are now focused on introducing initiatives and projects that will help define future products instead of actual products themselves.CES 2019 is like an entertaining Broadway musical that lacks a hit song.Still, I can usually count on smaller discoveries — a handful of products that everyone agrees were the most important introductions of the week. But even that consensus is hard to find this year. CES 2019 is like an entertaining Broadway musical that lacks a hit song. I can’t think of a single gadget anyone has talked about for more than a few hours before moving onto the next thing.What we have here is CES in an off year. In Intel’s “tick-tock” development model, this would be known as a tock year. A bigger year, a “tick,” introduces fundamental processor changes while the “tock” year sees only the implementation of those changes.For example, there’s that insane and adorable stuffed cat’s tail, Qoobo. After years of development, it’s finally shipping. But it’s not new!There’s a new smart lock. And there’s another. And another. When I found the fingerprint-activated BenjiLock at one event, the inventor explained he sold his two-year-old idea to Hampton Products (after surviving Shark Tank). They’ve made the lock smaller, sleeker, and reliable, but it’s not new.Did you hear about LG’s incredible rollable TV? Yes. Last year. The packaging is prettier, but it’s not new. Nor are the 8K TVs: They’re just bigger. Samsung has MicroLED for fully configurable displays, just like it did last year.There’s a fake doll with a baby monitor wrapped around its toe, staring at it through a camera eye or sneakily sliding under its crib-sized mattress. Creepy? Maybe. Familiar? Definitely.I was briefly excited about an iPhone case that contains a drone before someone informed me that an earlier, bulkier version was around last year. Not new.That robot folds laundry! Yeah, it was here last year and the year before.What about Google? Nothing that it’s showing off is new. The company is trying to add the “OK Google” voice command to everything, but it’s playing catch up to Amazon. Alexa really is everywhere, from big cars to tiny clocks.I saw a lot of interesting robots, but even my favorite, Kiki from Zoetic AI, is really a better version of the old Jibo. And those creepy flex-face robots reminded me of something I saw almost a decade ago.Even all the car tech — smart cars, all-screen dashboards, augmented reality in the windshield — is a synthesis of everything that’s come before it. I’ll grant that a walking car is new, but it’s also ridiculous.The peaks and valleys of innovation I enjoyed at previous CES events have flattened into a general hum of “more.” Thanks to easier access to 3D printing and prototyping services in China, there are more ODMs (original device manufacturers) than ever, but they all seem to be focusing on the same things. There are now many masks for your faces to calm snoring, sleep trouble, and even dry eye. There are wearable bands to help you calm down and devices to help you breathe.But there are no category-defining product innovations like the digital camera, the VCR, the MP3 player, the self-driving car, or the robot vacuum. New products are derivative of what’s come before. The innovations are largely on the software side, with traditional consumer electronics leveraging better silicon and sensors for more artificial intelligence and machine learning.It’s an issue that’s writ large across the entire tech industry, where innovation more often now is measured on a nanoscale, and breakthroughs are usually hidden behind a flat screen.Disappointment aside, CES still plays an important role in the technology ecosystem. Products that return year after year to showcase updates are inching their way closer to consumer availability. They can’t do so without the energy of the retailer who might hope to one day stock their shelves with a visionary product or the wordsmithing of a tech journalist who can’t wait to share their discovery with a wider audience.But that support doesn’t guarantee that any of these products will make it. Those entrepreneurs will go back to the drawing board to cook up their next big ideas, ones that I hope are ready in time for CES 2020.',_binary ' https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/fit/c/120/120/0*2xNB4UGWHvSWItK6.JPG https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2000/0*I6YCtMZwIeSYQAPf https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2000/0*kV6XDhtRC6dzrhkj https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2000/0*qDK4BjypBKDRsJU3 https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/fit/c/160/160/0*2xNB4UGWHvSWItK6.JPG https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/fit/c/300/300/0*2xNB4UGWHvSWItK6.JPG','833 claps','Lance Ulanoff',_binary 'Tech expert, journalist, social media commentator, amateur cartoonist and robotics fan.','Jan 10','4 min read'),(5,'How to Develop Better Habits in 2019','Forget resolutions—these simple, proven methods can make lasting changes in your life',_binary 'Just about everyone wants to cultivate better habits. The problem is, very few of us want to do the work to make those habits a reality. We hope they will magically develop, that one day we’ll just wake up (early, without even considering the snooze button) and head straight to the gym. Then we’ll have a healthy breakfast and sit right down with that creative project we’ve been putting off for months. At some point our desire to smoke or lie or complain will mysteriously disappear too.The reality? This has never happened for anyone, and it’s never going to happen. This is what inspired Epictetus’ famous quote from 2,000 years ago: “How long are you going to wait before you demand the best for yourself?” He’s really asking how much longer you are going to wait until you demand the best of yourself.I know I want to eat better and be more present. For a long time, I’ve wanted to do push-ups every day. I also want to work less and spend less time checking my phone. I want to start saying no so I can say yes to things I have been putting off. But I’ve wanted to make these changes for a long time. How do I transform my vague hopes into reality?To start, I need to develop better habits, better accountability, and a clearer vision for my day-to-day life. Here are the steps I am taking. We are all staring down the barrel of a new year, and if we aren’t going to do it now, when will we?Think Small—Really SmallThe writer James Clear talks a lot about the idea of “atomic habits” (and has a really good book with the same title). An atomic habit is a small habit that makes an enormous difference in your life. He talks about how the British cycling team was completely turned around by focusing on 1 percent improvements in every area. That sounds small, but it accumulates and adds up in a big way. He emphasizes thinking small with big habits. Don’t promise yourself you’re going to read more; instead, commit to reading one page per day. Thinking big is great, but thinking small is easier. And easier is what we’re after when it comes to getting started. Because once you get started, you can build.Create a Physical ReminderA physical totem can make the habit or standard you’re trying to hold yourself to into something more than an idea, and that helps—a lot. The author and minister Will Bowen has a simple system that helps people quit complaining. He provides each member of his congregation with a purple bracelet, and each time they complain, they switch the bracelet from one wrist to the other. This method is simple and straightforward and makes it easy to hold yourself accountable. Over my desk, I have a picture of Oliver Sacks. In the background he has a sign that reads “NO!” that helped remind him (and now me) to use that powerful word. One of the reasons we made coins for Daily Stoic was that when you have something physical you can touch, it grounds you. The coins are made at the same mint where the first Alcoholics Anonymous chips were invented, and they represent the same idea. If you have 10 years of sobriety sitting in your pocket or clasped in your hand, you’re less likely to throw it away for a drink.Lay Out Your SuppliesWhen I get to my desk in the morning, the three journals I write in are sitting right there. If I want to skip the habit, I have to pick them up and move them aside. So most mornings I don’t move them, and I write in them. You can use the same strategy if, for example, you want to start running in the morning. Place your shoes, shorts, and jacket next to your bed or in the doorway of your bedroom so you can put them on immediately. You’ll be less likely to take the easy way out if it’s embarrassingly simple to do the thing you want to do.Piggyback New Habits on Old HabitsIn 2018, I kept telling myself I wanted to contribute more to my community or be of more service. When I heard about someone volunteering, I would say to myself, “I’m going to start doing that.” I read about William MacAskill giving up a great deal of his income and thought, “Wow, I’d like to do something like that.” And then, of course, I didn’t do much of either. Then I listened to an interview with David Sedaris, who talked about how he likes to go on long walks and pick up trash near his home. I go for a walk nearly every morning. It’s an ingrained habit that’s part of my routine. Boom: I just added picking up garbage to my walk. This was easy because I had already done the heavy lifting of creating the first habit. Now it’s harder not to pick up trash, like when I don’t have a bag. Will this little activity save the world? Of course not. But it helps. And I can build on it.Surround Yourself With Good People“Tell me who you spend time with and I will tell you who you are” was Goethe’s line. Jim Rohn came up with the phrase that we are the average of the five people we spend the most time with. If you want to have better habits, find better friends. Most of my friends are in good shape. None smokes. Most are in good relationships. Most seem to have their shit together. I’m inspired to be better because I’m around them (and I get lots of good ideas for habits and activities). I’m also shamed into not being worse. If I started slipping, I would stand out.Commit to a ChallengeIn 2018, we did our first Daily Stoic Challenge, which was 30 consecutive days of different challenges and activities based on Stoic philosophy. It was an awesome experience. Even I, the person who created the challenge, got a lot out of it. Why? I think it was the process of handing myself over to a script. It’s the reason personal trainers are so effective. You just show up at the gym and they tell you what to do, and it’s never the same thing as the last time. Deciding what we want to do, determining our own habits, and making the right choices is exhausting. Handing the wheel over to someone else is a way to narrow our focus and put everything into the commitment. That’s why Whole30 is so popular. You buy a book and follow a regimen, and then you know what you’re doing for the next month.To kick off 2019 we’re doing another Daily Stoic Challenge, this time for 14 days. The idea is that you ought to start the new year right—with 14 great days to create momentum for the rest of the year. If you want to have better habits this year, find a challenge you can participate in. Just try one: It doesn’t matter what it’s about or who else is doing it.Make It InterestingAs I mentioned before, I’ve always tried to be someone who does push-ups every day. Since June, I’ve done at least 50 push-ups a day (sometimes as many as 100) almost without fail. How? I’ve been using Spar!, which is basically the most addictive and rewarding app I’ve ever downloaded. Right now I’m in a 50-push-up challenge with about two dozen people. Every day, we do 50 push-ups and upload video proof that we’ve done them. If you miss a day, the app charges you $5. At first you do the daily deed just so you don’t lose money. But soon enough, it’s about competing with the people in the group. Then a few days in, another motivation kicks in: The winners (people with the fewest misses) split the pot of everyone else’s fees. So you keep going because you want the reward. I’ve done thousands of push-ups, squats, burpees, and sit-ups (and even did one about cleaning my car and another about writing 500 words a day)—and in the process I also made a couple hundred bucks.It’s About the RitualProfessional dancer Twyla Tharp has written about how every morning she gets up early, dresses, and takes a cab to the same gym, where she works out for several hours. This is how she trains and keeps herself fit. Her workouts are tough and exhausting, and you’d think she would need a lot of discipline to commit to showing up each morning. But, as she writes in The Creative Habit, she just has to get herself to the cab. That’s it. The rest takes care of itself. The ritual takes over.It Doesn’t Have to Be an Everyday ThingI read a lot, but not usually every day. I do most of my reading when I travel, when I binge on books. Trying to force myself to read every single day (or for a set amount of time or a set amount of pages) would not be as productive or as enjoyable as periods of three to five days of really heavy reading (where I might finish three to five books). Binge reading may not be the right thing for everyone, but not every good habit has to be part of a daily routine. Sprints or batching can work too. What matters is that the results average out.Focus on YourselfOne of the reasons I’ve talked about watching less news and not obsessing over things outside your control is simple: resource allocation. If your morning is ruined because you woke up to CNN reports of another ridiculous Trump 2 a.m. tweet-storm, you’re not going to have the energy or the motivation to focus on making the right dietary choices or sitting down to do that hard piece of work. I don’t watch the news, I don’t check social media much, and I don’t stress about everything going on in the world—not because I’m apathetic, but because there are all sorts of changes I want to make. I just believe these changes start at home. I want to get myself together before I bemoan what’s going on in Washington or whether the U.K. will figure out a Brexit strategy. “If you wish to improve,” Epictetus said, “be content to be seen as ignorant or clueless about some things.” (Or a lot of things.)Make It About Your IdentityGenerally, I agree with Paul Graham that we should keep our identities small, and generally, I think identity politics are toxic. It’s a huge advantage, however, to cultivate certain habits or commitments that are foundational to your identity. For example, it is essential to my understanding of the kind of person I am that I am punctual. I also have decided that I am the kind of person who does not miss deadlines. That I see myself as a writer is also valuable because if I’m not writing, I’m not earning that image. You can see why being vegan becomes part of people’s identity too. If it was just about choosing not to eat any animal products, the diet would be extremely difficult to adhere to. But because it is a lifestyle and an ideology, vegans are willing to push through all that. They don’t see it as a choice, but rather as the right thing to do.Keep It SimpleMost people are way too obsessed with productivity and optimization. They want to know all the tools a successful writer or an artist uses because they think this is what makes these individuals so great. In reality, they are great because they love what they do and they have something they’re trying to say. When I look at some people’s routines and all the stuff they’re trying to manage, I shudder. Their habits require habits! No wonder they don’t make progress. My to-do lists are always short. I want my goals to be reachable, and I don’t want to be constantly busy or get burned out. This is why James Clear’s concept of atomic habits is so important. Look at the little things that make a big difference—not only is this more manageable, but the results will also create momentum.Pick Yourself Up When You FallThe path to self-improvement is rocky, and slipping and tripping is inevitable. You’ll forget to do the push-ups, you’ll cheat on your diet, you’ll get sucked into the rabbit hole of Twitter, or you’ll complain and have to switch the bracelet from one wrist to another. That’s okay. It doesn’t mean you’re a bad person. I’ve always been fond of this advice from Oprah: If you catch yourself eating an Oreo, don’t beat yourself up; just try to stop before you eat the whole sleeve. Don’t turn a slip into a catastrophic fall. And a couple of centuries before her, Marcus Aurelius said something similar:When jarred, unavoidably, by circumstance, revert at once to yourself, and don’t lose the rhythm more than you can help. You’ll have a better group of harmony if you keep on going back to it.In other words, when you mess up, come back to the habits you’ve been working on. Come back to the ideas here in this post. Don’t quit just because you’re not perfect.No one is saying you have to magically transform yourself in 2019, but if you’re not making progress toward the person you want to be, what are you doing? And, more important, when are you planning to do it?I’ll leave you with Epictetus once more, who wrote so eloquently about feeding the right habit bonfire. It’s the perfect passage to recite as we set out to begin a new year, hopefully, as better people.From now on, then, resolve to live as a grown-up who is making progress, and make whatever you think best a law that you never set aside. And whenever you encounter anything that is difficult or pleasurable, or highly or lowly regarded, remember that the contest is now: you are at the Olympic Games, you cannot wait any longer…',_binary ' https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/fit/c/120/120/0*oxw8NBp_Td0n3l4_.png https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/fit/c/160/160/0*oxw8NBp_Td0n3l4_.png https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/fit/c/300/300/0*oxw8NBp_Td0n3l4_.png','36K claps','Ryan Holiday',_binary 'Bestselling author of ‘Conspiracy,’ ‘Ego is the Enemy’ & ‘The Obstacle Is The Way’ http://amzn.to/24qKRWR','Dec 21, 2018','10 min read'),(6,'Nothing Can Stop Google. DuckDuckGo Is Trying Anyway.','2019 may finally be the year for ‘The Search Engine That Doesn’t Track You’',_binary 'In late November, hotel conglomerate Marriott International disclosed that the personal information of some 500 million customers — including home addresses, phone numbers, and credit card numbers — had been exposed as part of a data breach affecting its Starwood Hotels and Resorts network. One day earlier, the venerable breakfast chain Dunkin’ (née Donuts) announced that its rewards program had been compromised. Only two weeks before that, it was revealed that a major two-factor authentication provider had exposed millions of temporary account passwords and reset links for Google, Amazon, HQ Trivia, Yahoo, and Microsoft users.These were just the icing on the cake for a year of compromised data: Adidas, Orbitz, Macy’s, Under Armour, Sears, Forever 21, Whole Foods, Ticketfly, Delta, Panera Bread, and Best Buy, just to name a few, were all affected by security breaches.Meanwhile, there’s a growing sense that the tech giants have finally turned on their users. Amazon dominates so many facets of the online shopping experience that legislators mayhave to rewrite antitrust law to rein them in. Google has been playing fast and loose with its “Don’t Be Evil” mantra by almost launching a censored search engine for the Chinese government while simultaneously developing killer A.I. for Pentagon drones. And we now know that Facebook collected people’s personal data without their consent, had third party deals that would have allegedly made it possible for Spotify and Netflix to look at users’ private messages, fueled fake news and the rise of Donald Trump, and was used to facilitate a genocide in Myanmar.The backlash against these companies dominated our national discourse in 2018. The European Union is cracking down on anticompetitive practices at Amazon and Google. Both Facebook and Twitter have had their turns in the congressional hot seat, facing questions from slightly confused but definitely irate lawmakers about how the two companies choose what information to show us and what they do with our data when we’re not looking. Worries over privacy have led everyone from the New York Times to Brian Acton, the disgruntled co-founder of Facebook-owned WhatsApp, to call for a Facebook exodus. And judging by Facebook’s stagnating rate of user growth, people seem to be listening.For Gabriel Weinberg, the founder and CEO of privacy-focused search engine DuckDuckGo, our growing tech skepticism recalls the early 1900s, when Upton Sinclair’s novel The Jungle revealed the previously unexamined horrors of the meatpacking industry. “Industries have historically gone through periods of almost ignorant bliss, and then people start to expose how the sausage is being made,” he says.Gabriel Weinberg, DuckDuckGo CEO and FounderThis, in a nutshell, is DuckDuckGo’s proposition: “The big tech companies are taking advantage of you by selling your data. We won’t.” In effect, it’s an anti-sales sales pitch. DuckDuckGo is perhaps the most prominent in a number of small but rapidly growing firms attempting to make it big — or at least sustainable — by putting their customers’ privacy and security first. And unlike the previous generation of privacy products, such as Tor or SecureDrop, these services are easy to use and intuitive, and their user bases aren’t exclusively composed of political activists, security researchers, and paranoiacs. The same day Weinberg and I spoke, DuckDuckGo’s search engine returned results for 33,626,258 queries — a new daily record for the company. Weinberg estimates that since 2014, DuckDuckGo’s traffic has been increasing at a rate of “about 50 percent a year,” a claim backed up by the company’s publicly available traffic data.Just before DuckDuckGo’s entrance sits a welcome mat that reads, “COME BACK WITH A WARRANT.”“You can run a profitable company — which we are — without [using] a surveillance business model,” Weinberg says. If he’s right, DuckDuckGo stands to capitalize handsomely off our collective backlash against the giants of the web economy and establish a prominent brand in the coming era of data privacy. If he’s wrong, his company looks more like a last dying gasp before surveillance capitalism finally takes over the world.DuckDuckGo is based just east of nowhere. Not in the Bay Area, or New York, or Weinberg’s hometown of Atlanta, or in Boston, where he and his wife met while attending MIT. Instead, DuckDuckGo headquarters is set along a side street just off the main drag of Paoli, Pennsylvania, in a building that looks like a cross between a Pennsylvania Dutch house and a modest Catholic church, on the second floor above a laser eye surgery center. Stained-glass windows look out onto the street, and a small statue of an angel hangs precariously off the roof. On the second floor, a door leading out to a balcony is framed by a pair of friendly looking cartoon ducks, one of which wears an eye patch. Just before DuckDuckGo’s entrance sits a welcome mat that reads “COME BACK WITH A WARRANT.”“People don’t generally show up at our doorstep, but I hope that at some point it’ll be useful,” Weinberg tells me, sitting on a couch a few feet from an Aqua Teen Hunger Force mural that takes up a quarter of a wall. At 39, he is energetic, affable, and generally much more at ease with himself than the stereotypical tech CEO. The office around us looks like it was furnished by the set designer of Ready Player One: a Hitchhiker’s Guide to the Galaxy print in the entryway, Japanese-style panels depicting the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles in the bathroom, and a vintage-looking RoboCop pinball machine in the break room. There’s even a Lego model of the DeLorean from Back to the Future on his desk. The furniture, Weinberg tells me, is mostly from Ikea. The lamp in the communal area is a hand-me-down from his mom.Weinberg learned basic programming on an Atari while he was still in elementary school. Before hitting puberty, he’d built an early internet bulletin board. “It didn’t really have a purpose” in the beginning, Weinberg says. The one feature that made his bulletin board unique, he says, was that he hosted anonymous AMA-style question panels with his father, an infectious disease doctor with substantial experience treating AIDS patients. This was during the early 1990s, when the stigma surrounding HIV and AIDS remained so great that doctors were known to deny treatment to those suffering from it. Weinberg says that the free—and private—medical advice made the board a valuable resource for the small number of people who found it. It was an early instance of Weinberg’s interest in facilitating access to information, as well as a cogent example of the power of online privacy: “The ability to access informational resources anonymously actually opens up that access significantly,” he told me over email.After graduating from MIT in 2001, Weinberg launched a slew of businesses, none of which are particularly memorable. First there was an educational software program called Learnection. (“Terrible name… the idea was good, but 15 years too early,” he says.) Then he co-founded an early social networking company called Opobox, taking on no employees and writing all the code himself. “Facebook just kind of obliterated it,” Weinberg says, though he was able to sell the network to the parent company of Classmates.com for roughly $10 million in cash in 2006.It was around that time when Weinberg began working on what would become DuckDuckGo. Google had yet to achieve total hegemony over the internet search field, and Weinberg felt that he could create a browser plugin that might help eliminate the scourge of spammy search results in other search engines.Weinberg bought a billboard in San Francisco that proudly proclaimed, “Google tracks you. We don’t.” The stunt paid off in spades, doubling DuckDuckGo’s daily search traffic.To build an algorithm that weeded out bad search results, he first had to do it by hand. “I took a large sample of different pages and hand-marked them as ‘spam’ or ‘not spam.’” The process of scraping the web, Weinberg says, inadvertently earned him a visit from the FBI. “Once they realized I was just crawling the web, they just went away,” he says. He also experimented with creating a proto-Quora service that allowed anyone to pose a question and have it answered by someone else, as well as a free alternative to Meetup.com. Eventually, he combined facets of all three efforts into a full-on search engine.When Weinberg first launched DuckDuckGo in 2008 — the name is a wink to the children’s game of skipping over the wrong options to get to the right one — he differentiated his search engine by offering instant answers to basic questions (essentially an early open-source version of Google’s Answer Box), spam filtering, and highly customizable search results based on user preferences. “Those [were] things that early adopters kind of appreciated,” he says.At the time, Weinberg says, consumer privacy was not a central concern. In 2009, when he made the decision to stop collecting personal search data, it was more a matter of practicality than a principled decision about civil liberties. Instead of storing troves of data on every user and targeting those users individually, DuckDuckGo would simply sell ads against search keywords. Most of DuckDuckGo’s revenue, he explains, is still generated this way. The system doesn’t capitalize on targeted ads, but, Weinberg says, “I think there’s a choice between squeezing out every ounce of profit and making ethical decisions that aren’t at the expense of society.”Until 2011, Weinberg was DuckDuckGo’s sole full-time employee. That year, he pushed to expand the company. He bought a billboard in Google’s backyard of San Francisco that proudly proclaimed, “Google tracks you. We don’t.” (That defiant gesture and others like it were later parodied on HBO’s Silicon Valley.) The stunt paid off in spades, doubling DuckDuckGo’s daily search traffic. Weinberg began courting VC investors, eventually selling a minority stake in the company to Union Square Ventures, the firm that has also backed SoundCloud, Coinbase, Kickstarter, and Stripe. That fall, he hired his first full-time employee, and DuckDuckGo moved out of Weinberg’s house and into the strangest-looking office in all of Paoli, Pennsylvania.Then, in 2013, digital privacy became front-page news. That year, NSA contractor Edward Snowden leaked a series of documents to the Guardian and the Washington Post revealing the existence of the NSA’s PRISM program, which granted the agency unfettered access to the personal data of millions of Americans through a secret back door into the servers of Google, Yahoo, Facebook, Apple, and other major internet firms. Though Google denied any knowledge of the program, the reputational damage had been done. DuckDuckGo rode a wave of press coverage, enjoying placement in stories that offered data privacy solutions to millions of newly freaked-out people worried that the government was spying on them.“All of a sudden we were part of this international story,” Weinberg says. The next year, DuckDuckGo turned a profit. Shortly thereafter, Weinberg finally started paying himself a salary.Today, DuckDuckGo employs 55 people, most of whom work remotely from around the world. (On the day I visited, there were maybe five employees in the Paoli office, plus one dog.) This year, the company went through its second funding round of VC funding, accepting a $10 million investment from Canadian firm OMERS. Weinberg insists that both OMERS and Union Square Ventures are “deeply interested in privacy and restoring power to the non-monopoly providers.” Later, via email, Weinberg declined to share DuckDuckGo’s exact revenue, beyond the fact that its 2018 gross revenue exceeded $25 million, a figure the company has chosen to disclose in order to stress that it is subject to the California Consumer Privacy Act. Weinberg feels that the company’s main challenge these days is improving brand recognition.“I don’t think there’s many trustworthy entities on the internet, just straight-up,” he says. “Ads follow people around. Most people have gotten multiple data breaches. Most people know somebody who’s had some kind of identity theft issue. The percentage of people who’ve had those events happen to them has just grown and grown.”The recent investment from OMERS has helped cover the cost of DuckDuckGo’s new app, launched in January 2018. The app, a lightweight mobile web browser for iOS and Android that’s also available as a Chrome plugin, is built around the DuckDuckGo search engine. It gives each site you visit a letter grade based on its privacy practices and has an option to let you know which web trackers — usually ones from Google, Facebook, or Comscore — it blocked from monitoring your browsing activity. After you’ve finished surfing, you can press a little flame icon and an oddly satisfying animated fire engulfs your screen, indicating that you’ve deleted your tabs and cleared your search history.The rest of the recent investment, Weinberg says, has been spent on “trying to explain to people in the world that [DuckDuckGo] exists.” He continues, “That’s our main issue — the vast majority of people don’t realize there’s a simple solution to reduce their [online] footprint.” To that end, DuckDuckGo maintains an in-house consumer advocacy blog called Spread Privacy, offering helpful tips on how to protect yourself online as well as commentary and analysis on the state of online surveillance. Its most recent initiative was a study on how filter bubbles — the term for how a site like Google uses our data to show us what it thinks we want — can shape the political news we consume.Brand recognition is a challenge for a lot of startups offering privacy-focused digital services. After all, the competition includes some of the biggest and most prominent companies in the world: Google, Apple, Facebook. And in some ways, this is an entire new sector of the market. “Privacy has traditionally not been a product; it’s been more like a set of best practices,” says David Temkin, chief product officer for the Brave web browser. “Imagine turning that set of best practices into a product. That’s kind of where we’re going.”Like DuckDuckGo — whose search engine Brave incorporates into its private browsing mode — Brave doesn’t collect user data and blocks ads and web trackers by default. In 2018, Brave’s user base exploded from 1 million to 5.5 million, and the company reached a deal with HTC to be the default browser on the manufacturer’s upcoming Exodus smartphone.Google knows that I’m in Durham, North Carolina. As far as DuckDuckGo is concerned, I may as well be on the moonTemkin, who first moved out to the Bay Area in the early ’90s to work at Apple, says that the past two decades of consolidation under Google/Facebook/Netflix/Apple/Amazon have radically upended the notion of the internet as a safe haven for the individual. “It’s swung back to a very centralized model,” he says. “The digital advertising landscape has turned into a surveillance ecosystem. The way to optimize the value of advertising is through better targeting and better data collection. And, well, water goes downhill.”In companies such as Brave and DuckDuckGo, Temkin sees a return to the more conscientious attitude behind early personal computing. “I think to an ordinary user, [privacy] is starting to sound like something they do need to care about,” he says.But to succeed, these companies will have to make privacy as accessible and simple as possible. “Privacy’s not gonna win if it’s a specialist tool that requires an expert to wield,” Temkin says. “What we’re doing is trying to package [those practices] in a way that’s empathetic and respectful to the user but doesn’t impose the requirement for knowledge or the regular ongoing annoyance that might go with maintaining privacy on your own.”In November, I decided to switch my personal search querying to DuckDuckGo in order to see whether it was a feasible solution to my online surveillance woes. Physically making the switch is relatively seamless. The search engine is already an optional default in browsers such as Safari, Microsoft Edge, and Firefox, as well as more niche browsers such as Brave and Tor, the latter of which made DuckDuckGo its default search in 2016.Actually using the service, though, can be slightly disorienting. I use Google on a daily basis for one simple reason: It’s easy. When I need to find something online, it knows what to look for. To boot, it gives me free email, which is connected to the free word processor that my editor and I are using to work on this article together in real time. It knows me. It’s only when I consider the implications of handing over a digital record of my life to a massive company that the sense of free-floating dread about digital surveillance kicks in. Otherwise, it’s great. And that’s the exact hurdle DuckDuckGo is trying to convince people to clear.Using DuckDuckGo can feel like relearning to walk after you’ve spent a decade flying. On Google, a search for, say, “vape shop” yields a map of vape shops in my area. On DuckDuckGo, that same search returns a list of online vaporizer retailers. The difference, of course, is the data: Google knows that I’m in Durham, North Carolina. As far as DuckDuckGo is concerned, I may as well be on the moon.That’s not to say using DuckDuckGo is all bad. For one, it can feel mildly revelatory knowing that you’re seeing the same search results that anyone else would. It restores a sense of objectivity to the internet at a time when being online can feel like stepping into The Truman Show — a world created to serve and revolve around you. And I was able to look up stuff I wanted to know about — how to open a vacuum-sealed mattress I’d bought off the internet, the origin of the martingale dog collar, the latest insane thing Donald Trump did — all without the possibility of my search history coming back to haunt me in the form of ads for bedding, dog leashes, or anti-Trump knickknacks. Without personalized results, DuckDuckGo just needs to know what most people are looking for when they type in search terms and serve against that. And most of the time, we fit the profile of most people.When I asked Weinberg if he wanted to displace Google as the top search engine in all the land, he demurred. “I mean, I wouldn’t be opposed to it,” he says, “but it’s really not our intention, and I don’t expect that to happen.” Instead, he’d like to see DuckDuckGo as a “second option” to Google for people who are interested in maintaining their online anonymity. “Even if you don’t have anything to hide, it doesn’t mean you want people to profit off your information or be manipulated or biased against as a result [of that information],” he says.Even though DuckDuckGo may serve a different market and never even challenge Google head-on, the search giant remains its largest hurdle in the long term. For more than a decade, Google has been synonymous with search. And that association is hard, if not impossible, to break.In the meantime, the two companies are on frosty terms. In 2010, Google obtained the domain duck.com as part of a larger business deal in a company formerly known as Duck Co. For years, the domain would redirect to Google’s search page, despite seeming like something you’d type into your browser while trying to get to DuckDuckGo. After DuckDuckGo petitioned for ownership for nearly a decade, Google finally handed over the domain in December. The acquisition was a minor branding coup for DuckDuckGo — and a potential hedge against accusations of antitrust for Google.That doesn’t mean relations between the two companies have improved. As the Goliath in the room, Google could attempt to undercut DuckDuckGo’s entire business proposition. Over the past few years, even mainstream players have attempted to assuage our privacy anxieties by offering VPNs (Verizon), hosting “privacy pop-ups” (Facebook), and using their billions to fight against state surveillance in court (Microsoft). With some tweaks, Google could essentially copy DuckDuckGo wholesale and create its own privacy-focused search engine with many of the same protections DuckDuckGo has built its business on. As to whether people would actually believe that Google, a company that muscled its way into becoming an integral part of the online infrastructure by selling people’s data, could suddenly transform into a guardian of that data remains to be seen.When it comes to the internet, trust is something easily lost and difficult to regain. In a sense, every time a giant of the internet surveillance economy is revealed to have sold out its customers in some innovatively horrifying way, the ensuing chaos almost serves as free advertising for DuckDuckGo. “The world keeps going in a bad direction, and it makes people think, ‘Hey, I would like to escape some of the bad stuff on the internet and go to a safer place,’” Weinberg says. “And that’s where we see ourselves.”',_binary ' https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/fit/c/120/120/1*sQ0GLVTkBJIX49OP_uc_5Q.jpeg https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2000/1*Lr-66FtquA-cYHuZ4iYwRQ.jpeg https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2000/1*IL9RMMxagMHyyhQt8VI8nA.jpeg https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2000/1*s6749RQm1gdz02dvVUQwIQ.jpeg https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1200/1*OU-b4th16b49_BUikJUKiQ.jpeg https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1200/1*QjYhTThuPyWImplXwc1N_Q.jpeg https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1200/1*9fxLlVHOGGpdsuOJoQaLjw.jpeg https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/fit/c/160/160/1*sQ0GLVTkBJIX49OP_uc_5Q.jpeg https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/fit/c/300/300/1*sQ0GLVTkBJIX49OP_uc_5Q.jpeg','2.6K claps','Drew Millard','','Jan 15','15 min read');
